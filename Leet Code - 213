    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1) return nums[0];
        return Math.max(robSimple(nums, 0, n - 2), robSimple(nums, 1, n - 1));
    }

    private int robSimple(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int prev = 0, curr = 0;

            int temp = Math.max(curr, prev + nums[i]);
