sol - 


class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return head;

        ListNode curr = head;
        while(curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            if (curr.val == curr.next.val) {
                curr.next = curr.next.next;
            }
            else curr = curr.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
